# vue-ble

This project makes use of [Web BLE](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/bluetooth/) to connect to a scale. The scale used is the Xiaomi Mi Scale which has been documented [here](https://github.com/wiecosystem/Bluetooth/blob/master/doc/devices/huami.health.scale2.md) by [wiecosystem](https://github.com/wiecosystem).

This project was inspired by [limhenry](https://github.com/limhenry/) after reading their [article](https://dev.to/henrylim96/reading-xiaomi-mi-scale-data-with-web-bluetooth-scanning-api-1mb9)
